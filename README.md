I'm proud to share the project I developed over the course of three days, I created a chat application as a test for the firm called Monke Labs. The app includes several key features that enhance the user experience.

First and foremost, users can register and log in to the app, allowing them to create their own personalized accounts. This ensures a secure and tailored experience for each user.

One of the main features of the app is the ability to send messages to a public group. Users can engage in real-time conversations, participating in lively discussions and connecting with a global community.

To make message management easier, I implemented various options. Users can delete their own messages from the public group, giving them control over the content they share. Additionally, they can save important messages for future reference and even copy specific messages as well.

I also wanted to provide users with the ability to personalize their profiles, so I included an avatar customization feature. Users can select and change their avatars, adding a touch of individuality and creativity to their profiles.

Overall, I'm thrilled with the progress I made in such a short span of time. I believe these features will contribute to an engaging and enjoyable user experience.



To clone a repository and run a React project locally, you can follow these steps:

1. Install Git: If you don't already have Git installed on your machine, download and install it from the official website (https://git-scm.com/).

2. Open your terminal or command prompt: You'll need to use the command line to clone the repository and run the project.

3. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository: Use the `cd` command to change directories. For example, if you want to clone the repository into your "Projects" folder, you can use `cd Projects` to navigate there.

4. Clone the repository: In the terminal, use the `git clone` command followed by the repository URL. For example:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
   ```

   Replace "username" with the repository owner's username and "repository" with the name of the repository you want to clone. This will create a local copy of the repository on your machine.

5. Navigate to the project directory: Use the `cd` command to navigate into the cloned repository. For example:

   ```
   cd repository
   ```

   Replace "repository" with the actual name of the repository you cloned.

6. Install project dependencies: In the project directory, run the following command to install the required dependencies specified in the project's package.json file:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

   This command will use npm (Node Package Manager) to download and install all the necessary packages and libraries.

7. Start the React project: Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the React project by running the following command:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the development server and launch the React project in your default web browser.

That's it! You should now have the React project cloned and running locally on your machine. You can access it by opening your web browser and navigating to the specified development server URL, usually http://localhost:3000/.
