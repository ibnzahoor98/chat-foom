I'm proud to share the project I developed over the course of three days, I created a chat application as a test for the firm called Monke Labs. The app includes several key features that enhance the user experience.

First and foremost, users can register and log in to the app, allowing them to create their own personalized accounts. This ensures a secure and tailored experience for each user.

One of the main features of the app is the ability to send messages to a public group. Users can engage in real-time conversations, participating in lively discussions and connecting with a global community.

To make message management easier, I implemented various options. Users can delete their own messages from the public group, giving them control over the content they share. Additionally, they can save important messages for future reference and even copy specific messages as well.

I also wanted to provide users with the ability to personalize their profiles, so I included an avatar customization feature. Users can select and change their avatars, adding a touch of individuality and creativity to their profiles.

Overall, I'm thrilled with the progress I made in such a short span of time. I believe these features will contribute to an engaging and enjoyable user experience.
